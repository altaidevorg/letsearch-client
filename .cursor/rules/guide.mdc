The `letsearch-client` project provides a Python client library (`LetsearchClient`) acting as a **Facade** for interacting with a remote Letsearch semantic search server via its REST API. It encapsulates HTTP communication using `httpx`, managed internally by the `_request` helper abstraction, providing methods for server health checks, collection management, and performing semantic searches. **Pydantic models** serve as *Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)*, ensuring type safety and validation for API data exchange.

In addition to the client library, the project includes essential *tooling* (`export_to_onnx.py`) for preparing sentence embedding models for deployment within the Letsearch backend. This tooling handles the conversion of Hugging Face Transformer models to the **ONNX** format for portability and optimized inference. It further incorporates a **model quantization** workflow (FP16, INT8) using `onnxruntime` to significantly reduce model size and potentially accelerate inference, addressing common challenges in deploying large ML models efficiently. The project thus provides both the means to *interact* with a Letsearch instance and the tools to *prepare* the necessary AI models for it.
